## 📸 Device Overview
The **ESP32-WROOM-32** (Revision v3.1) features 10 internal capacitive touch sensors. These sensors measure the electrical charge on a pin; this value drops significantly when a finger interferes with the pin's electric field.

## 📋 Exeperiment Specifications
* **Hardware:** ESP32 DevKit V1 (30-pin version).
* **Touch Input:** GPIO 4 (Labeled as **D4** on the board).
* **Visual Output:** Internal Blue LED (Connected to **GPIO 2**).
* **Source Code:** [Click Here to Paste Your GitHub Link]

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 0: Preparation
1. Ensure your ESP32 is connected to your PC via a Micro-USB data cable.
2. Confirm the **Red Power LED** on the board is illuminated.

### Step 1: Environment Setup
1. Open the **Arduino IDE**.
2. Navigate to **Tools > Board** and select **DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1**.
3. Go to **Tools > Port** and select the active **COM Port** for your device.

### Step 2: Code Deployment
1. Copy the source code from the GitHub link provided in the Specifications section above.
2. Paste the code into your Arduino IDE workspace.
3. Click the **Upload** arrow ($\rightarrow$).
4. **Note:** If the IDE console shows `Connecting...`, press and hold the **BOOT** button on your ESP32 until the upload progress begins.

### Step 3: Monitoring
1. Open the **Serial Monitor** (Top right magnifying glass icon).
2. Set the communication speed to **115200 baud**.
3. Observe the idle baseline value (should be approximately **1764** for this specific board).

## 🚀 Result Section

### 1. Physical Interaction
* **Action:** The user touches the metal header of pin **D4**.
* **Observation:** The capacitance value displayed in the Serial Monitor drops instantly from the baseline to below **1000**.

### 2. Hardware Response
* **Effect:** The internal **Blue LED** triggers immediately upon contact, glowing bright blue.
* **Release:** The LED turns off as soon as the finger is removed from the pin.

## 💡 Key Takeaway
You have successfully turned a standard GPIO pin into a **Capacitive Touch Button**. Because this senses electrical fields rather than physical pressure, the sensor can even function through thin non-conductive materials like paper or plastic.
